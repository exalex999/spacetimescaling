# spacetimescaling
The program transforms n input bitmaps to m output ones (scaling “in time”), interpolating “gaps” according to Lanczos resampling algorithm, and additionally adjusts their size (scaling in “space”, i.e. normal scaling) using scaling method specified by user (nearest-neighbor, linear or bicubic).
